## Why Would You Want To Download Videos On Instagram?


Here are five reasons you might want to download either your own videos or other account’s videos you find online. 

1.	Offline Viewing: You might want to watch videos at times you don’t have wifi or cellular data options available.

2.	Content Backup: Downloading videos ensures that you have a backup copy of your favorite content in case the original is deleted or the account is deactivated.

3.	Editing and Repurposing: Downloading videos enable you to edit and repurpose them for your own personal use, such as creating a compilation or adding your own captions and effects. Quick note, if you are downloading other people’s videos to use in your own project, you could be breaking copyright laws. It’s always best to ask for permission. 

4.	Educational Purposes: Downloaded videos can be used for educational purposes, such as teaching a class or creating a presentation. You can embed fun videos into your classroom presentation to keep students interested. Video is a powerful educational tool.  

5.	Sharing with Friends and Family: Downloading videos allows you to easily share content with friends and family who may not have their own Instagram accounts.

Open your settings menu to go to “settings and privacy.” Scroll to the bottom and tap on “archiving and downloading.” This is where you can change your settings to add your Instagram stories to your camera roll automatically. 

You can download your own reels while you are still in edit mode. The only caveat is it will download without audio unless you are using original audio. To download your own Reels with audio, read the section below on how to use a website or app to download any video on Instagram.

## Can You Download Other People’s Videos On Instagram?

Instagram doesn’t have a way within its native app to download videos from accounts you don’t own. Although they do offer a limited ability to “remix” reels, there is no way within Instagram to download videos, reels, or stories on other accounts. 

Luckily, there are several websites and apps that will help you accomplish this anyway. You’ll be able to download videos from any public account, both business and personal accounts. These workarounds will not work, however, if the account is set to private. 

You might be wondering if it’s safe or even legal to download photos and videos from an account you don’t own. Actually, as long as the account is set to public, then it’s fair game to download for personal use. How you intend to use it after that could become limited based on copyright laws. 
How To Download Instagram Videos From A Computer

To download Instagram Reels with audio from your own account or from any public account, you can use one of several free third-party services. There are many out there, but here are a few you can get started with. 

If you want to browse Instagram content on your computer and have the ability to save photos and videos quickly, you can download a Google Chrome extension such as [IG Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ig-downloader/cpgaheeihidjmolbakklolchdplenjai). It is free to download and easy to install on your browser. 

If you don’t want to use an extension, you can visit one of the many free websites allowing video downloads. You will see ads on these pages; that’s how the service makes money. The ads are not too bothersome and are a small price to pay for an otherwise free service.

Here are two of the top websites for downloading Instagram Reels according to how they are ranked on Google:
1.	SaveInsta
2.	SnapInsta

In order to use this service, you’ll need the URL of the video you want to download. On your Instagram mobile app, open the reel you want to download and tap on the small icon that looks like an arrow. This is the “share” icon; from here, you can choose to share this video with a friend, or you can tap on “copy link.” Use that copy link feature to grab the URL and paste it into the search bar on one of the services mentioned above. 

The website will bring up the video, and it will have a download button for you. You’ll normally see a brief pop-up ad before being able to download. Save your video to your computer and use it however you want. 

## How To Download Instagram Videos Using Your Phone 

Since most people use Instagram on their mobile phones instead of on a computer, it might make more sense for you to download an app that will download the videos for you and save them to your phone’s camera roll. 

On Android, one of the best apps to download Instagram videos is called Story Save. You can use it to save both photos and videos, and the app is free to download. The app itself works a lot like the websites we mentioned above. You will feed the app the URL of the photo or video, and it will download it for you, 

Another app for downloading from Instagram for both Android and iOS is called [Insaver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insaver-repost-for-instagram/id1579857563). It works the same way Story Save does; there aren’t too many steps to follow. Which app you choose to download will basically come down to personal preference. 

To stay safe and protect your account, never use a third-party tool for Instagram that requires you to input your personal account login information. All of these download tools do not need to access your own account for any reason. Instagram is not a fan of using any third-party tools that require your login credentials as it exposes their platform to additional risk. 

## How To Track Any Pubilc Instagram Account Without Detection

For a small fee, you can create a weekly report about any pubic account that shows you follower and following activity, hobbies and interests, and other tracking information you may find helpful.
